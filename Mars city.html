            Mars Science City would have pressurised biodomes in which ecosystems could be sustained. Dubai Media Office. Sarwat Nasir. June 23, 2021. Construction of the world's largest Mars simulation city is to begin in the Dubai desert next year, with completion and the start of operations scheduled for 2024.

      <h2> Dubai's government announced plans for "Mars Science City" at the annual United Arab Emirates (UAE) government meetings in Abu Dhabi, on Sept. 26. The site is set to be the "largest space stimulation city ever built," according to the government's press release, and expected to cost 500 million United Arab Emirates dirhams (approximately $136,124, 800). The project will be lead by the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre, and developed with global firm Bjarke Ingels Group in collaboration with a team of Emirati scientist, engineer, and designers.</h2><br>
      <h2>The 1.9-million-square-foot campus' walls will be made of 3D-printed sand from the Emirati desert and house a space museum. In it, visitors will find displays on mankind's greatest achievements in space exploration and research, as well as access to numerous educational programs. <br><br></h2>

        <h2>The space will also include laboratories that simulate life on Mars, utilizing 3D-printing technology and radiation insulation to try and replicate the climate and challenges astronauts would face on the red planet.These amenities will also serve to condition a team of scientists that will take part in a year-long immersion experience involving living in the imitated Martian city, in hopes of providing more insight into real-life conditions and subsequent needs. </h2>
<h2>This new project is part of the UAE's Mars 2117 Project plans—revealed in February of this year—which "aims at its final stage to establish the first inhabitable human settlement in Mars by 2117," according to a press release by the government.</h2>

<h2><br>
    Mr Al Rais said the city would include several features that would allow scientists from all over the world to carry out research related to the red planet.<br><br>

“The Mars Science City will be a platform where we’re going to have our future space robotics lab, future analog facilities, a habitat and a space sustainability lab,” he said.<br><br>

“We’re currently working on the design. Then we’ll do the construction for the next two years. Hopefully, the city will be ready and operational towards the end of 2024.<br><br>

“We are also working with our partners for identifying the requirements for unique analog facilities as part of the Mars Science City.”<br><br>

An analogue facility is a simulation of the harsh space-like environment, where humans live in isolation for several weeks or months to prepare for future space exploration missions.<br><br>

As part of a different project, MBRSC has shortlisted two Emirati candidates who will travel to Russia at the end of this year to live in a Mars analogue facility for eight months.<br><br>

If analogue facilities are built in Mars Science City, it would give Emirati astronauts easier access to training in such simulated environments.<br><br>

Mr Al Rais said an architect has not yet been selected for the city, but there have been proposals.<br><br>

Architects Bjarke Ingels Group proposed 3D underground buildings and recommended solar energy to power and heat the city.<br><br>

As part of the UAE’s Mars programme, MBRSC also sent the Hope probe into space, to orbit around the Red Planet. The robotic craft is currently capturing scientific data about the planet’s upper and lower atmosphere.
